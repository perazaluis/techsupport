# Technical Support @ Planet

This is the repository of the Technical Support team at Planet. It contains all scripts and tools developed by the team both for external (customers) and internal (planeteers) support.

## Getting Started


These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

```
This will move any previously existing keys to a the folder .ssh/save/ just in case. Take the default options and enter a passfrase when asked.
